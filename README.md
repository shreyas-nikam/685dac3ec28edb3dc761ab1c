# Streamlit Data Analysis and Visualization App

## Project Title and Description

This Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and visualizing data. It allows users to upload a CSV file, perform basic data analysis, and create various interactive visualizations. The app aims to simplify data exploration and make it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.  It includes features for displaying dataframes, calculating descriptive statistics, creating histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.

## Features

*   **Data Upload:** Upload data from a CSV file directly through the web interface.
*   **Data Preview:** Display the uploaded data in a tabular format for easy viewing.
*   **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate and display descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for numerical columns.
*   **Data Filtering:** Filter data based on column values.
*   **Data Sorting:** Sort the data based on selected columns.
*   **Histograms:** Generate histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical data.
*   **Scatter Plots:** Create scatter plots to explore the relationship between two numerical variables.
*   **Box Plots:** Generate box plots to visualize the distribution and outliers of numerical data across different categories.
*   **Download Results:** Allow users to download processed data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python:** Version 3.7 or higher is recommended.  You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **Pip:** Python package installer (usually included with Python installations).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (Optional, if you have the files locally, skip to step 2):**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

    Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the GitHub repository. Replace `<repository_directory>` with the name of the folder created after cloning.

2.  **Create a virtual environment (Recommended):**

    This will isolate the project's dependencies.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment:

    *   **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    *   **On macOS and Linux:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If you don't have `requirements.txt`, and are just running based on code shared elsewhere, you can install the packages individually:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```


## Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit application:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    Replace `app.py` with the actual name of your Streamlit application file.

2.  **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and go to the address displayed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3.  **Using the application:**

    *   **Upload Data:** Click the "Browse files" button in the sidebar to upload a CSV file.
    *   **Data Preview:** The uploaded data will be displayed in a table in the main panel.
    *   **Descriptive Statistics:** Select the numerical column you want to analyze in the sidebar.  Descriptive statistics will be displayed below the table.
    *   **Filtering Data:** Enter values into the filter boxes under each column to filter data.
    *   **Sorting Data:** Click the column headers to sort the data by that column.
    *   **Visualization:** Choose a visualization type (Histogram, Scatter Plot, Box Plot) from the sidebar.  Select the necessary columns for the chosen visualization. The visualization will be displayed in the main panel.
    *   **Download Data:** Click the "Download Processed Data" button to download the filtered and sorted data as a CSV file.
